- Created SO for each card
- Created system to build a SO inside Unity Editor (it can be done automatically if the assets are tagged/named with a normalized format)
In this case I received the assets as card_suit0_value00, etc... 

One can always create a script to read these files and based on its name, parse it and create automatically each Scriptable Object for each card on the set.
In this case I made it manually since the amount of cards is not going to change( as opposed to a Collectible Card Game for example)

If the art would change, it's just a matter of rewriting such script to allow updating the sprite on each SO.
